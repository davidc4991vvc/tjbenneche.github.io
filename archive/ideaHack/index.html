				<h1>Our mission</h1>
				<p>With Elevate Chicago, we aim to positively impact new venture formation in Chicago and accelerate the growth and/or expansion of established technology businesses.</p>
				<h1>What is the problem?</h1>
				<p>The current system, while certainly of nobel intent, is seriously flawed. The three existing verticals, Bioscience, Clean Tech, and Web Mobile, lack a comprehensive communication system, the ability to engage the public in a meaningful way, and a critical feedback loop to ensure continued progress.</p>
				<h1>Why does it matter?</h1>
				<p>Chicago has incredible potential as a hub for growth companies in tech and hard sciences, but is struggling to attract young talent to the city and retrain the potential stars graduating from our colleges. Northwestern and UChicago are the two largest MBA programs in the world, and that is certainly a market from which the city needs to heavily recruit. With recent grads acquiring jobs so quickly (just 3 months after graduating, on average), Chicago companies need to mainting a serious presence on campus early on to show students the opportunities that exist right here.</p>
				<h1>What is our solution?</h1>
				<p>Our solution lies in communication. By creating an extensive and efficient internal and external communication platform, Elevate Chicago seeks to address the issues of public engagement and accountability.</p>
